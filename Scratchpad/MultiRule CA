Every cell contains rule parameter references
Every cell contains Neighbourhood references

Smaller neighbourhoods cannot be killed by large neighbourhoods

Current referenced neighbourhoods from living cells get overwritten if unoccupied by smaller neighbourhood

CGoL Gliders could pierce ManyRing atoms uninhibited:
    ManyRing atom can still reference CGoL cells, but cannot overrite neighbourhood/rule
        Live CGoL cells 'protect' all referenced neighbourhood cells from overwrite
        When small neighbourhood living cells move on and cells are no longer referenced, they can be overwritten

I guess small-NHood rules would convert larger rules to be smaller rules step-by-step when life cells are impacted.
Neat chain reactions incoming!
