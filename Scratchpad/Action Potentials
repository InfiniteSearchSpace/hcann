blockchain currency transactions as the action potential controllers 
for a distributed computational / neural network?

Pay another cell to do your requested work/processing

cell pays other cells, big mesh network processing

Very expensive (computationally) or very popular algos become more expensive action potential thresholds

Pyramid it, so that child modules have to pay a tiny % fee to their ancestor cell's APs?

financially incentivise the creation of new better models at large scales
    Encourage automated searching / module discovery

Economies are truth-seeking & efficiency-seeking
